## Improvements

### Caching

At first, making calls to the API had some latency issues whether or not that was because of the hosting provider I wasnâ€™t sure however I wanted to prevent it being from something I could control. The backend.

And so I decided to make the first step be caching.

Caching is the temporary storage of values / data such that instead of making a new connection to the DB, increasing costs, latency and delay, we can grab said data from the cache which is a drastically quicker alternative.

The response time from the /login route was:

```python
Duration: 1.4123912391239 
```

After performing a simple cache:

```python
Duration: 0.920147180557251
```

To achieve this i used the cahce_tools module, utilising the cached decorator to get it below 

### SQL Queries

Unnecessary loading of columns can slow down an API response due to the redundancy. to fix this, when checking for existing users I did

```python
SELECT id FROM table_name
WHERE email=%s
```

By doing this, we load only one column and one item drastically improving response time, bringing us into the sub 1s
